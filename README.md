# Next.js Redirect in useEffect Hook within Custom Component
This repository demonstrates a common issue in Next.js applications where redirecting within a custom component's `useEffect` hook can cause unexpected behavior.  The problem arises due to the timing of the redirect and the component's render cycle.  The solution proposes several ways to properly handle redirects within custom components, ensuring a smooth user experience without infinite loops or unexpected outcomes.

## Problem
When using `useRouter` to redirect within the `useEffect` hook of a custom component, the redirect might not work as expected, or it may lead to an infinite redirect loop if the redirect condition is met repeatedly.

## Solution
The proposed solution addresses this issue by providing alternative ways of performing redirects. These include using `router.replace` for a non-browsing history based redirect and handling the condition more carefully to prevent the loop.
